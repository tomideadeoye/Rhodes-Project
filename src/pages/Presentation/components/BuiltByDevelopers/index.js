            One of the tasking responsibilities of businesses in this digital age is transcending
            the noise and communicating their brand essence in a way that captures consumer
            attention and converts those attention into desirable actions for the business.
            <br />A recent study by Microsoft Corp reveals that the average attention span of a
            human is about 8 seconds and several brands are already competing for this time. What
            makes you stand out each time is a compelling brand message that prospects can identify
            with, a huge part of why storytelling matters. <br />
            There is no stronger connection between humans than storytelling. People want to
            interact with brands that see them, understand their needs and reflect their values â€“ No
            better way to compel action and drive behavior than infusing storytelling into your
            digital marketing campaigns.
